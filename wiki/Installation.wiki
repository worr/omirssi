= Dependencies =

Obviously, omirssi requires irssi and perl. However, it also requires the perl module WWW::Omegle which you probably don't have, and which is probably not present in your OS's package manager. Install it using CPAN below.

{{{
# perl -MCPAN -e shell
cpan[1]> install WWW::Omegle
}}}

= Script Installation =

Installing the script is easy, just pop it in ~/.irssi/scripts/ if you want to just install it for your user, or /usr/share/irssi/scripts/ to install it system wide.
