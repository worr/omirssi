# Loading the script #

One loads the script like any other irssi script, with a quick /script load omirssi.
It creates a new window called omegle if one doesn't already exist, and lives inside that window.

# Chatting #

  * /om\_connect - starts a new omegle session with a stranger
  * /om\_disconnect - ends the running omegle session
  * /om\_say - sends a message to the current omegle session
  * /om\_rename - changes what they're called in the irssi interface
